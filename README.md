SpaceJam Hackathon

This is an app Made in Android Studio
There are a lot of things would like to add to this
The project must be Cloned from this repo into a new project in Andrid Studio and it can be run in any emulator or Physical device
The ML processing part has to be executed sepeartely(first.py)..
It had to be in the app after the photo was clicked...But we ran into some SDK and Dependency errors-So it has to executed seperately
